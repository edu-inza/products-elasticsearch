But it s very much alike to a 00 gauge. But this train set isn t an add-on for an electric train set nor has nothing to do with one.I bought this for my 4 year old nephew as he adores trains but is far too young for an electric set.

His mouth dropped open with surprise! (no joke  it literally did!)It s very easy to connect the plastic track/assemble  it takes 2 mins. It s very easy to connect the trains together and apply to track.All you need is two AA batteries and time to watch your child enjoy themselves!We even added homemade tunnels to this to make it more fun  we simply cut holes in cardboard boxes to put around certain parts of the track!This is brilliant for very young kids if they re very interested in trains.

To be fair i dont think there is much longevity with it and after a while my daughter played with the train itself rather than the train and track although it does still come out now and again. I had read some reviews that you have to keep building the track as it comes apart easily. I think that depends on if your child is heavy handed or not  i havent had to keep putting it back together but i could see that if a child was a bit heavy handed then you would be up and down all the time. I have taught my 2 year old to try and put it back together on her own and she can mangae to do some bits but does force them together if they are round the wrong way  but time will cure that. Overall yes im glad i got it for her and i dont regret buying it  there are better products out there or might be just worth getting them the trains on there own. | Excellent entertainment set // 5.0 // 11 Feb. 2014 // By  Milena Solakova     on 11 Feb. 2014 // We have a lot of fun time with my son with this series.

They are pretty tough so have survived some bashing. Only thing is that he can t get them to attach to each other with the ball/ socket joint  it s a bit fiddly so I have to help with that (repeatedly as they do come apart quite easily!) However  this won t be an issue as he gets older. Only got Brewster and Wilson this time to see how he got on  but think I will be getting the track and Koko for xmas as he plays with these for ages and loves talking to them (not sure he realises the trains talk to each other  he just thinks they talk to him... could be setting myself up for years of counselling with that :) | Fabulous toy // 5.0 // 2 Feb. 2014 // By  Patsy     on 2 Feb. 2014 // I bought the whole set of chuggington interactive trains and train set for my grandsons to play with when they come to visit which is only twice a year as they live in Italy.  I think I have had more fun with them listening to them speak to each other  I am absolutely fascinated with them. | Doesnt Fit on Chuggington Rail Tracks // 2.0 // 17 Feb. 2014 // By  Ian Halstead     on 17 Feb. 2014 // The toy is much larger than other Chugginton toys and doesnt fit on any of the Chuggington rail tracks.

They are fun when they talk to each other & helps to build up an interactive  imaginative game. Not the most robust of toys but fine for kids who don t play too roughly! | Great buy // 5.0 // 5 Aug. 2013 // By  MrsJ     on 5 Aug. 2013 // I bought this for my son who has a Chuggington train set  and it s definitely worth having at least 2trains to interact with each other. It took his enjoyment of the track to another level. | Great toy // 4.0 // 2 Jan. 2013 // By  Mrs Louise Johnson     on 2 Jan. 2013 // Bought for our 2 yr old twin boys to build up their collection  great interactive toy  and works well with the other Chugginton characters we have. Fast delivery also | Excellent // 5.0 // 16 Aug. 2013 // By  Mark Wilson     on 16 Aug. 2013 // Good size  very sturdy and well made. The interaction between the trains is very good.

P. Long    TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 16 Oct. 2014 // This is a pretty decent starter set as a first step into model railways.You get a very nice detailed model of the Gloucester City and its tender  and three equally well-detailed model coaches. The locomotive is DCC-ready. (DCC is the digital control system for model railways allowing different trains to run at different speeds o the same tracks - DCC-ready indicates that the loco has a socket into which a DCC module can be slotted in future; the controller provided with the set is not DCC-compatible.)As with all Hornby starter sets  there is sufficient track included for a simple oval circuit with a single siding and one set of points. Hornby points are a bit flimsy - they don t seem to click as positively into one side or the other as I remember those on the model railways of my youth doing  but the track is fine otherwise. The fishplates are reassuringly tight  and it all slots together easily. There is also a trackmat supplied  which is a rather grand name for a large printed sheet of glossy paper with a suggested layout  to make all of which requires you to buy rather a lot of extra track and accessories - more a piece of marketing than anything really useful.The supplied controller is a simple rheostat - you can turn the speed up and down and select forward or reverse  but it s all you need to get started. (If you get keen  you can buy a DCC module for the locomotive and a DCC controller to give more control options for a more sophisticated layout.)Putting it all together took 20 minutes or so - it s reasonably obvious how you assemble it all  which is fortunate as the supplied instructions are a bit sketchy. Not really a problem  as most bits will only fit one way!Read more â€º | The loco is nice and sturdy and has a good weight to it // 4.0 // 3 Dec. 2015 // By  Mr. JB Smedley     on 3 Dec. 2015 // A typical Hornby starter set. The loco is nice and sturdy and has a good weight to it  and for a railroad model the detail is very good! The Pullman coaches are equally attractive to look at  and feel as though they will last a good while. The track included  while a fairly minimal amount  is sufficient to get the set moving comfortably. The only downside in my opinion is the controller feels very cheap. I would not expect to see much use from it. However for the fact I am viewing this as simply a test model for something much larger  it will not see too much heavy use anyway. The loco runs smoothly and quietly  and I can t wait to see it running on a much larger layout! | Good starter for the enthusiast // 5.0 // 1 Dec. 2015 // By  Otago     on 1 Dec. 2015 // Great item as usual from Hornby Loco is well detailed above Hornby s  Railroad  versions in my opinion.A nice quality set  far too good for younger children who would easily damage  though a good starter set for the enthusiast. | Excellent set  in the main // 4.0 // 14 Oct. 2014 // By  Mr Gumby    TOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 14 Oct. 2014 // This is a lovely set to own and my only serious reservation is that you really need to spend quite a lot more on extras  to get the best out of it. As a starting point  it s great though.The track is good-quality but does need a flat  solid base. You ll need to spend time getting the creases out of the supplied 1600x1180mm MidiMat too.The detailing on the locomotive and carriages is pretty good. The conn rods move nicely and you can see inside the carriages  with their white `table cloths  and gold-coloured lamps. It could be better still but most people will be perfectly happy with it  as I am.The box suggests all sorts of further sets to enhance this one. The Basic Oval and Track Pack A (R8221) are included  to create an extended oval with a siding. Adding Track Packs B and C (R8222 and R8223) gives you a double oval with siding (but just one pair of points connecting them). D and E (R8224 and R8225) make it really interesting  but that s almost £100  so far  and you can still add F (R8226) for extra sidings. Oh  and you ll need a new 1800x1200 TrakMat  R8217  to go with packs E and F.Then you ll want to add accessories such as stations  signal boxes and engine sheds. The message is...don t imagine £150 for this set will be the end of your expenditure!Without at least the extra track  the set will be pretty dull unless you just want to go round and round in circles with the occasional foray into the siding. Hence 1 star deducted for  fun .Some parts  notably some of the couplings  seem rather fragile. I wouldn t recommend this set for younger children and would suggest 8 as an absolute minimum  and only with a lot of adult supervision. 10 or 12 would be better.Read more â€º | A good starter set. // 4.0 // 19 Jan. 2015 // By  William Wade     on 19 Jan. 2015 // This is the railroad version of the Duke of Gloucester which is slightly less detailed than the top of the range model and consequently less fragile. The three Pullman coaches are also from the Railroad range and do not have interior lighting as do the top of the range models. It is a pity that the roofs are silver and a bit flashy  they would have been better in grey. Another slight inconvenience is that the couplings do not match. The loco has the newer style couplings and the coaches the wider older style but this does not impede hooking up however. This train set was a real bargain at the price I paid at the time.,

Plastic model kit. Manufacturers Description: William Stanier (1876-1965) was headhunted from the GWR to become Chief Mechanical Engineer of London  Midland and Scottish (LMS) Railways in 1932. With the support of the Chairman  Sir Josiah Stamp  Stanier is credited with modernising the LMS fleet of generally small steam locomotives with a larger  modern and more powerful array of designs. Soon after his appointment  Stanier also focused on refurbishing and standardising the Coach stock of the LMS and developed the Period III LMS coaches which later became known as Stanier Coaches. These designs were extremely popular and successful and many were still in service in the mid 1960’s. There are many examples of Period III coaches operating on Heritage Railways throughout the UK today. The Dapol OO Model of the Stanier Coach is derived from refurbished Airfix/Mainline tooling originally purchased by Dapol in the 1980’s. There are some compromises on detail accuracy due to the condition and usability of the 40+ year old tooling. However  we feel the model captures the essence of the Period III coach design well and offers an extremely affordable way of building up a fleet of pre or post nationalised fleet of LMS coaches. Dapol have strived to ensure livery and colour details have been captured and are comparable to the originals  including the roof level gold lines. The Kit comes complete with decorated body  all that is required is painting of the roof and other components and assembly.

Plastic model kit. Manufacturers Description: William Stanier (1876-1965) was headhunted from the GWR to become Chief Mechanical Engineer of London  Midland and Scottish (LMS) Railways in 1932. With the support of the Chairman  Sir Josiah Stamp  Stanier is credited with modernising the LMS fleet of generally small steam locomotives with a larger  modern and more powerful array of designs. Soon after his appointment  Stanier also focused on refurbishing and standardising the Coach stock of the LMS and developed the Period III LMS coaches which later became known as Stanier Coaches. These designs were extremely popular and successful and many were still in service in the mid 1960 s. There are many examples of Period III coaches operating on Heritage Railways throughout the UK today. The Dapol OO Model of the Stanier Coach is derived from refurbished Airfix/Mainline tooling originally purchased by Dapol in the 1980 s. There are some compromises on detail accuracy due to the condition and usability of the 40+ year old tooling. However  we feel the model captures the essence of the Period III coach design well and offers an extremely affordable way of building up a fleet of pre or post nationalised fleet of LMS coaches. Dapol have strived to ensure livery and colour details have been captured and are comparable to the originals  including the roof level gold lines. The Kit comes complete with decorated body  all that is required is painting of the roof and other components and assembly.

I m just a 63 year old leaner. I ve always wanted a. Train set I m into G gauge at the momentAlso 00 gauge and N gauge.  Sorry. Steve,Horny R1138 GWR Frieght Train review // 4.0 // 20 Nov. 2013 // By  Saltrampen     on 20 Nov. 2013 // I bought this Train set for my son and am a complete novice when it comes to Train sets.The Hornby set feels solid and attention is paid to the detail on the train. It comes with a mat  which is actually a giant printed poster. For the long term  a hard backing is needed.The track layout feels like it is the next size up from a basic layout as it already contains an extension pack.The train itself is not huge and looks silly pulling long  passenger carriages (as it would on a real train).It is quite expensive and had I not seen it at a reduced price  I probably would not have bought it (hence 4 / 5). The train can actually go quite fast in both directions. As novice I have discovered several features that must be well known to train set enthusiasts:The Trains can be tricky to get all wheels on the track. (I think there is an accessory to help with this)Big Long carriages do not like tight bends at speed (they come off).When using points to guide the train onto an inner circuit (I bought more track) you need to get jumper leads from Hornby and these are not included in Extension packs A & B.Without these the train loses power  but I think they are relatively cheap.The Track needs to be cleaned with a cloth  as any grease / dirt can stop the power to the trainTrain track has to be carefully aligned when joining one section to another  so continually putting it away and getting it out is time consuming - setting it up on a hard backing is a better solution.My child is very careful with the set and its contents  but not an ideal present for kids who leave it lying around and step on it (the carriages are expensive). I can see why people like train sets and this is a good introductory set with the plethora of accessories and trains etc from Hornby  and others we were left wanting to buy more bits and pieces (such as electric rather than manual points) after using this set. | Excellent introduction  to the hobby. // 5.0 // 26 Oct. 2014 // By  A. Miles    VINE VOICE on 26 Oct. 2014 // Every child should own a train set  and lately I ve started suspecting that every middle-aged man should have one too  so I ordered this so that  me and my little lad will have a shared interest. (And   if he turns out to be more interested in video games and hoverboards and whatnot  that s OK too: I shall move the layout to my shed and drink homebrew alone  whilst building titchy windmills).It s nice to see  after not handling  a set since the early 70s  that Hornby still maintains that quality old-school feel  lots of detailed modelling and reassuring metal components. This starter set represents a small pre-war Welsh local service  with both passenger and freight carriages  but comes with a printed landscape mat which shows you how you might extend this into a more ambitious layout.It s very difficult to find anything to criticise about this set: I guess everyone knows that Hornby are the Dons of the model railway game  and the price is what it is: They ve always been quite expensive toys. One issue might be that most larger layouts now are apparently controlled digitally  whereas this is on an old style analogue controller  which I guess means that if you decide to build up to a set with more trains  etc  this  set would have to run on a separate track?So  I m really glad i own a trainset again  and am looking forward to spending my dotage buying tiny little tins of humbrol enamel in shades like GWR Olive Drab and staring into the windows of model shops wondering whether to invest in the  1/72 00/H0 Village Garage with Petrol Pump. | Great starter set  but do your research // 4.0 // 3 Jan. 2015 // By  dmcnabb    TOP 500 REVIEWER on 3 Jan. 2015 // My son was purchased this train set for Christmas. My son is mad on trains and loves model train sets set up in shops  museums etc. I have never used a Hornby set before  but it is clearly well thought out  very detailed and is high quality. The first time I put it together I was surprised how fiddly it was  it certainly is not for a child to put together. The track was huge  but there is not an awful lot of variety to the set  it can be oval or circular and that s about it. It comes with a large poster of the ground that is ideal for aesthetics  but in the long term its best to be on some sort of hard backing - and here is where the issue with this is. It is such a great toy  very classic  but to put it on a board is so much more complicated than it appeared for a few reasons. 1. It s huge  to put it on a board you need a dedicated space where it could be on a table or put away in some sort of bespoke contraption. We have allocated space under a double bed for the board. A chunk of MDF this size is around £15-£20. 2. My second idea when I realised how much floor space it takes up I thought it may be better to go up a mountain for example  but to go up you need to slope very very gradually  otherwise it climbs a bit and slides back down. I put one side sloping up using a how to train your dragon book on each side and two at the end and it couldn t climb up the far end. 3. Once you accept its going to take up a loafs of space  and once you accept it won t slope upwards much you will naturally look to add variety to the track. We looked at having the large oval with two half circles on the inside by adding 3 3rd radius double curves in two places in the middle (total of 6)  as well as one more left hand curve and straight and two right hand curve and straight pieces.Read more â€º,{seller=>[{Seller_name_1=>KNC Toys  Seller_price_1=>£65.00}  {Seller_name_2=>Amazon.co.uk  Seller_price_2=>£69.99}  {Seller_name_3=>Gaugemaster  Seller_price_3=>£79.95}  {Seller_name_4=>Gameseek  Seller_price_4=>£80.48}  {Seller_name_5=>CLIFFORD JAMES  Seller_price_5=>£79.99}  {Seller_name_6=>Frome Models Centre  Seller_price_6=>£89.99}  {Seller_name_7=>TrainStop  Seller_price_7=>£91.99}  {Seller_name_8=>Models & Computers Plus  Seller_price_8=>£92.99}  {Seller_name_9=>GamesQuest  Seller_price_9=>£104.99}]}

This is a very modern style of wooden-framed steel panelled side-corridor coach  with a steel chassis  and end-vestibule entrances and `concertina  connections for accessing other carriages. Some internal detail can be seen through the windows  such as the partitions and seating  and there are opaque-window lavatory compartments.

It is packaged in the current standard Piko card box with a transparent window  and a transparent plastic side-opening tray inside.This is a nicely detailed model of a high standard of manufacture  with a small packet of delicate bits for you to add. There are other models available to form a rake of these coaches.Note that I paid £37 for my model when new  so it is worth shopping around in your local model shops - or even a distant one.

I needed a controller and decided that a Gaugemaster was a good choice.  As I will be building the model railway in stages I wanted something to get me started and the single track contoller was ideal.  It didn t take me long to get it conected which is simple. I found it to be very smooth and I could maintain any speed  even very slow speeds without a problem and it would just run at that speed for as long as needed.  I will in due course buy a Gaugemaster multi track controller but this is ideal for what I need at this time.  I have been using this controller for several weeks now and I am still very pleased with it. | This is not a toy! // 4.0 // 3 Feb. 2013 // By  Lincolnshire Ned     on 3 Feb. 2013 // Next day free delivery!

I know they moved name plates of engines around but A3s were introduced in 1927 and A1s in 1945. | Excellent  well constructed model // 5.0 // 22 Nov. 2015 // By  Amazon Customer     on 22 Nov. 2015 // Bought as present for my myself!.

Easy to set-up  just assign 2x 2 digit accessory addresses from your DCC controller ( Each signal head is commanded independently ) and its ready to use. Full instructions included along with a ladder & sign plate to add even more realism if you so wish.  I have the Hornby E-link & Railmaster system and these work perfectly with it. Other types of signal are also available with single heads  distant & Home types. The real benefit of these signals is that because they are wire-free you can move them on your lay-out quickly if you change your mind or layout  so worth the extra cost compared with regular signals. plus they are LED for a long life. | Easy bit with placement limitations // 3.0 // 12 Oct. 2015 // By  CeeBee     on 12 Oct. 2015 // Not bad.

More to play with than just a small set of trucks or coaches. Fun // 5.0 // 8 Oct. 2015 // By  J. Whitehouse     on 8 Oct. 2015 // Good little train set  something different to the normal with having a crane.The crane is the normal Hornby Breakdown crane  which you can get in a  steam era  rusty colour or modern painted yellow.  This one is red with a British Rail symbol on the side (like from the 1980s). Of course  that doesn t match with steam train (a few decades out!); but this being a beginners train set that won t matter most young children (just be careful if your recipient is very clued up on these things!). The crane is weighted so it won t tip over when used to lift derailled trucks and wagons.  Add on winders are plugged in to operate the hook and crane height. Excellent pulley mechanism for raising the crane arm.The train has a plain colour scheme  like a general shunting train  as if it were one of many of the same kind. Almost gave it 4 stars because of this  but it s low priced so it stays at 5.The controller  track  wagon are all the usual good Hornby quality.Excellent small starter trainset  especially if you want to do more than just watch a train go round and round..... | Great set // 5.0 // 16 April 2015 // By  Allotment holder     on 16 April 2015 // Great amount of track  high quality crane and boxcar.lovely little loco  its not a pocket rocket it runs at a really nice speed for its size  its not a Mallard but its still one of my favourite locos I own(You can tell somethings good when a teenager gives 5 stars) | Nice set but not for everyone // 4.0 // 8 Jan. 2016 // By  C. Bodden     on 8 Jan. 2016 // Nice starter set - has the standard basic oval and Track Pack one track  and a midi mat. The mat is paper  so not really durable for using over and over again unless you build a baseboard.The locomotive is a little under powered for the wagons - you need to be quite gentle setting off to prevent slipping  and the crane is quite hard to position on the rails  so maybe not the best for younger children who might get frustrated with.The detail on the engine is quite basic - if you like realism a bit of weathering may be good to make it look a bit better.

J. Reynolds    TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 18 Dec. 2014 // This is an excellent kit that has been around for more than fifty years . Detail is not what would be expected these days - the heavily applied boiler bands and handrails  detract from an otherwise accurate kit . These faults can   however   be rectified with care and despite this   the basic kit has been the basis over the years for countless   motorised   working  models . Not only can the kit be used to build a GWR  City  class loco but determined  kitbashers  can use it as the basis for several broadly similar GWR classes from the early years of the twentieth century .

Easy click together build. // 4.0 // 27 Feb. 2015 // By  T. Scharf     on 27 Feb. 2015 // Just built one of these! The body is self coloured in the right colour and the sides are lined out and lettered. The ends need to be painted black. Apart from the roof ventilators (which can be glued inside the roof) the whole kit clicks together ingeniously. It took about 10 mins to assemble this kit and the next will take more like 4 minutes. The only transfers/decals are the round LMS logos you can see in the centre.I don t agree with the assembly instructions! The body comprises sides ends and floor in a single piece. There is a rectangular cutout in the floor for the metal weight. I would fit the interior seat moulding into the body first. There is very little space between the compartment walls and the side of the coach to feed the flush-glaze window strips in. (They can t go in first) Particularly on the 2nd window strip I was concerned that I might overstretch the coach side at the end and make the plastic go milky. I was relieved when the glazing clicked into the windows. At that point  with the windows correctly in place  the corridor connections can be slid in the ends and the underframe offered up to the body (upside down with the metal weight located). The underframe latches actually click into the window strips to tie it all together. Likewise the roof clicks onto tabs on the window strips. Ingenious!Assembling and fitting the bogies was quite easy. The coupling retainers were fiddly though. Each coupling is plastic with a black metal hook. One of the hooks fell off. There is a C shape feature which clips onto a plastic bar and I needed to crunch it slightly with pliers  then adjust outwards with a screwdriver again until it clicked into place. The hook doesn t lift and drop as freely as it should now. It s on account of that and not being able to build the coach in the assembly instruction order (without feeling I was going to break something) that I ve docked a star.,{seller=>[{Seller_name_1=>Gaugemaster  Seller_price_1=>£12.30}  {Seller_name_2=>Emmasaurus Shop  Seller_price_2=>£17.25}]}

Box Contains 1x Coach Model,,,A very good model with only a few of shortcomings // 5.0 // 8 Aug. 2014 // By  DAVE HORN     on 8 Aug. 2014 // These ex-LNER Gresley teak-bodied buffet cars  built in the 1930 s  survived long enough to receive all three British Railways coach liveries  crimson and cream  maroon (in which this model is also currently available) and finally the blue and grey depicted here used from the mid-1960 s.  I ve given this one 5* as opposed to the maroon one s 4* as in my opinion it looks much better in this blue and grey livery.  The reviews are virtually the same apart from that rating.  Presumably they lasted so long as a new buffet car cost much more than a new ordinary coach to build. It s stated on the Net that the last one was withdrawn in 1977 from Western Region use as W9135E  whilst the one depicted here  E9131E  lasted only until 1974.This model is up to the usual standard of recent Hornby coaches and  whilst a scale person wouldn t fit into the gap between the seats and tables  you must peer in through the windows to appreciate the best interior detail. It s a lovely little bar/counter complete with chrome edging  an (empty) transparent sandwich display case  what looks like a chrome coffee-maker and one of those metal foot-rests running the length of the bar/counter complete with the little pegs that hold it above floor level. No stools though  presumably to encourage folks to buy the curly sandwiches  over-priced drinks and then bog off back to their seats leaving it clear for more punters to part with their hard-earned.There s also a representation of the hand-rails at the windows by the buffet bar/counter to hold onto going over the points at junctions (or after a few expensive tinnies (which is all they used to have (and still do as far as I m aware) in the beers department.Read more â€º | Five Stars // 5.0 // 5 Mar. 2015 // By  philip adair pullinger     on 5 Mar. 2015 // Fantastic.,{seller=>{Seller_name_1=>Howleys Toy Shop  Seller_price_1=>£60.25}}

However I was left a little dissapointed. I was under the impression each chugger interacted with each other automatically. This is not so  you have to continually press the horn of each chugger and then they will interact and comment on what is around them i.e tunnell  chugwash etc....This is ok for older children who have grasped the idea and know what to do. But for younger children it reverts to a push along train and in effect is no different from the die-cast edition. I know as my child gets older he will develop his play but I feel a little mis-led by the concept. I have also had to return the action chugger as the paint on the wings was peeling. I have asked for a replacement however as action chugger is the main man in our household! Enjoy! | Wheels to the rails! // 4.0 // 22 April 2011 // By  Fledge     on 22 April 2011 // My 3 year old son loves his talking trains - they are in his top 3 toys. We initially bought him Koko and Wilson for Christmas but could not find a Brewster to go with them  so promised him one for his birthday  then we got him the Brewster with track and tunnel set. I have to say he gets more pleasure from the trains than the tracks  which are rather fiddly to set up (grown-ups have to do this) and he doesn t seem to have grasped that you have to raise the drawbridge with the little lever - if you raise it by hand  it tends to lift off the tracks so I m constantly having to help him put it back. He also keeps switching the tunnel off for some reason. However  the toys are very sturdy  the trains in particular have been subjected to a certain amount of bashing but have withstood all ill treatment (I do take them away if he gets too boisterous).The trains are beautifully made - bright  sturdy  cheerful and just like their TV counterparts  with nice clear voices which are also individually distinctive. They prompt imaginative  interactive play - he talks to them and makes up stories for them  and we have to stop him taking them to bed with him otherwise he would stay up all night chatting! There seems to be quite a wide range of comments between the trains  although disappointingly  only a couple of responses to the tunnel and drawbridge. The trains respond over quite a large distance  for example he has left one on the stairs and you could hear it joining in while he played with the others in the living room  so I would say at least within hearing range. Of course now he wants the Chugwash (he saw it on the side of the box) so further sets & trains will have to be added in future...Read more â€º | My son loves this // 5.0 // 28 Dec. 2010 // By  Amazon Customer     on 28 Dec. 2010 // I bought this for my 3 year old son for christmas and he hasn t stopped playing with it  for a last minute purchase it has turned out to be the best.

It was the smallest of the  Big Four  railway regions with most of it s revenue coming from passenger traffic rather than freight in the more densely populated region of southern England. A number of famous  named  trains were operated by SR including the Brighton Belle  Bournemouth Belle  Golden Arrow  the Night Ferry (London - Paris and Brussels)  Atlantic Coast Express and the Devon Belle. Both Richard Maunsell and Oliver Bulleid served as Chief Mechanical Engineers to the SR between 1923 and 1948 and both designed new locomotives and rolling stock to replace those inherited in 1923. The electrification of the region began in 1929 under the management of Sir Herbert Walker. On completion it was the world s largest electrified railway system. Southern Railway gave the designation 2-BIL to the DC third rail electric multiple units built during the 1930s. The formation was a 2-car set: MBTL-DTCL  and were called 2-BIL (2-car Bi-Lavatory stock) because each set had two lavatories  one in each car. They were built to work long distance semi-fast services on the newly electrified lines from London to Eastbourne  Portsmouth and Reading. Between 1935 and 1938  a total of 152 sets of the Class 2-BIL were built in 4 batches and were numbered 2001-2152. Numbers 2001-2010 in 1935 for service on the London to Eastbourne sector.

Only has a couple of phrases on it s own. I only have 2 interactive trains  they say a few things to each other but not a lot. You would need everthing for it to say as much as it can! To be honest  my son would have been happy if it didn t say anything at all. He played with them when I first got them and now they don t get out of the toy box much  but that s just kids! | Very clever little toys // 5.0 // 14 Dec. 2010 // By  Dusty     on 14 Dec. 2010 // Ordered a pair of these toys for use with the Interactive train set which I got my son for Christmas.First impressions are that the toys had me and the wife chuckling away in astonishment at how smart they are  they will actually recognise who they are talking to by name and interact with a couple of sentences. Most times it seems to be a different phrase but I can imagine the kids having loads of fun as I believe they will interact with the track itsself as well.Got them on special offer with Amazon  would work out fairly expensive paying full price for them all but for a fiver each  SUPER!!! | Foreign koko // 1.0 // 3 Jan. 2012 // By  Mr. Kiff     on 3 Jan. 2012 // My daughter bought this for herself with her Christmas money  very disappointed when it turned up and wasn t English speaking.We have Wilson and when they speak English they are great  that s the only reason it has been marked down. | Toddler loves it!

I bought 3 different sets to build a larger layout  and not a hand in site on any of the pictures !Quality of the track and engines and extras very good  but the technology to make them move is not new   and would have been so simple and easy to install as they need batteries anyway. | let s interact.... but only if you push the button!! // 4.0 // 24 Aug. 2010 // By  cremcaramel77     on 24 Aug. 2010 // Slightly dissapointed that they don t interact automatically.

Recommended. // 4.0 // 15 April 2015 // By  Antony Dalton     on 15 April 2015 // A very good train set and very popular with the young infants in my family (from 2-5 years old).  The range of layouts that you can build is good and the pieces are easy to assemble even for little ones.  Both trains run well in the tracks.  The wood is a good fine grain that does not splinter easily  and is well finished  so is safe for children to handle.  It is also quite robust.  A couple of minor issues.  The track supports for the elevated section are rather too narrow and can fall over easily.  If they were a square section they would be more stable and support the elevated pieces much better.  This can be remedied by cutting duplicate supports and glueing them together to make the square cross section.  Also a couple of extra pieces to act as joining pieces would help add yet more variety to the layout designs.  One that is needed is another double hole joint and the other a double plug connector.  Nevertheless overall it is a highly recommended product that can keep youngsters safely occupied for hours.  But for these minor failings I would have given it 5 stars. | Good set for the price. // 4.0 // 26 May 2014 // By  Mr Gary J West     on 26 May 2014 // The only problem is that you have to play very delicately with parts of the set as the bridges are raised up on wood blocks that are easily knocked over by small hands and feet. | Fantastic train set // 5.0 // 10 Aug. 2015 // By  Bex     on 10 Aug. 2015 // Fantastic train set  my 2y/o loved this.

It is a short four-wheeled vehicle with smooth flat sides  and two end platforms. Some internal detail can be seen through the windows. The running number is Munchen PpostL 21029.This model is fitted with the standard â€˜loopâ€™ style of coupling. It is packaged in the current standard Trix card box with a transparent window with the usual transparent plasticky internal packaging  but with only a base and two folding-up end-pieces  no top.This is a beautifully detailed model  as you would expect from Trix  with some fine details already in place  but there is a packet of delicate bits for you to add. It is of a high quality of manufacture.Note that I paid £32 for my model  so it is worth shopping around in your local model shops â€“ or even a distant one.,{seller=>{Seller_name_1=>bw bahn  Seller_price_1=>£27.40}}

This is an interesting and finely-detailed model  and would be an excellent decoration for a farm or country scene.As you would expect from Preiser  these figures are of a high quality of manufacture  detail and colouring. Note that I originally paid £14 for my set  so it pays to shop around in your local model shops â€“ or even a distant one. I live in London  but find it worth travelling as far as Faversham in Kent to the Hobby Shop there for my models.,{seller=>{Seller_name_1=>Smaller World Future  Seller_price_1=>£137.16}}

Completed in 2008  Tornado was the first such locomotive built in the United Kingdom since Evening Star  the last steam locomotive built by British Railways  in 1960. Designed to meet modern safety and certification standards  Tornado runs on the UK rail network and on mainline-connected heritage railways.The locomotive was built by the A1 Steam Locomotive Trust  a charitable trust founded in 1990 to build Tornado and possibly further locomotives. Tornado was conceived as an evolution of the LNER Peppercorn Class A1 class  incorporating improvements likely had steam continued  and changes for cost  safety  manufacturing and operational benefits  while replicating the original design s sound and appearance. Tornado  completely new-built  is considered the 50th Peppercorn A1  numbered next in the class after 60162  Saint Johnstoun  built in 1949.Tornado moved under her own power for the first time on 29 July 2008 at Darlington  and then spent two months at the preserved Great Central Railway double-track tourist railway in Loughborough  where she was tested up to 60 mph (97 km/h) and operated her first passenger train. Tornado then moved to the National Railway Museum (NRM) in York for three test runs on the main line up to 75 mph (121 km/h). After repainting into LNER Apple Green  Tornado was approved for main-line passenger operation. On 31 January 2009 she hauled her first passenger trip on the main line  The Peppercorn Pioneer  from York to Newcastle and back. By hauling various A1 Trust railtours  charters and other activities  Tornado will begin to recoup the estimated £800 000 debt from the project  which cost around £3 million.The new Hornby model is represented in the familiar Apple Green of the early British Railways colour scheme.Young or old  keen modeller or just a beginner  the Hornby RailRoad range answers the needs of many and is a perfect complement to the variety of locomotives  rolling stock  track  buildings  and accessories that can be found in the current Hornby catalogue. Devoid of easily damaged detail parts the suitably livered RailRoad locomotives are fitted with efficient drive mechanisms and have pickups on all drive wheels ensuring smooth running. All the RailRoad models are fitted with the standard Hornby hook and bar type couplings and will therefore easily couple to those locomotives and rolling stock in both the standard Hornby and Thomas & Friends ranges. With this in mind it is easy to see that those models that make up the Hornby RailRoad range are a simple and cost effective way of adding to a train set providing a suitable and most appropriate stepping stone into the varied and fascinating World of model railways.The introductory range offers not only a selection of individual locomotives  rolling stock and accessories but an assortment of train and wagon packs ideally suited for either train set rolling stock enhancements or for those who wish to experiment and try their hands at developing their modelling techniques!This DCC Ready locomotive is compatible with analogue train layouts  but can easily be converted for use on a DCC (digital) layout. This loco is  DCC Ready   meaning they feature a special socket ready to receive a DCC Decoder. To convert this locomotive for use on a DCC layout one of the following digital decoder chips are required; R8245 Sapphire Decoder or R8249 V1 3 NMRA Loco Decoder. Once this decoder is fitted it is ready to use on a DCC layout.

Very difficult to tell // Yes  all exactly same scale.,Excellent // 5.0 // 30 April 2011 // By  Ella     on 30 April 2011 // I bought this for my 2 year old grandson and he loves it so much. I have also bought him others in the series. They are very strong toys due to being die cast and do take a lot of banging and bumping about during play  without damage to their paintwork.My grandson is obsessed with rescue scenarios at the moment and loves to bring Kevin in to help if James crashes. The fact that James talks too enthralls him. He get s so excited everytime he gets a new engine  as he wants to hear what it sounds like. He has to date..Thomas  Spencer  Percy  Diesel  Toby and some other s. He has Bertie bus and a small Harold too.It s great they have magnets too which means all the engines can pull each other and their tender s. He likes to swap them all about and put them all together in a long line. This is one of the toys I ve seen him having the most pleasure from so far. He plays contentedly for hours with these engines  making up his own scenarios.I have more of these put away for him  and have just given him Spencer which he again loved.One little comment  I wish it was made plain in Amazon s product details which ones talk and don t. Which are die cast etc  I find myself sometimes going through products for an age  or going to other sites  to make sure I have the right one.Sometimes a search for talking brings up non talking in the mix as well. Not a major point and not a dig at Amamzon as I use them constantly and I m always pleased with the service  but it would make shopping for these quicker and easier.

The first electric all-Pullman service in the world  it ran from 29 June 1934 till 30 April 1972.The London  Brighton and South Coast Railway was also the origin of the familiar British umber and cream Pullman livery. In 1903 Billinton changed the colour of the ordinary L.B. & S.C.R. coaches to umber brown with white or cream upper panels  and in 1906 this colour scheme was also adopted by the Pullman Car Co.  with the name of the car in large gilt letters on the lower panel and flanked on each side by a coloured transfer of the Pullman Company s crest.Another all-Pullman service was introduced in 1908 under the name of the Southern Belle. Contemporary advertising by the L.B. & S.C.R. claimed that this was ... the most luxurious train in the world.... In 1908 this could be experienced for a special London Victoria to Brighton day return fare of 12 shillings  a premium rate at a time when average earnings were around £1 a week. The Southern Belle was steam hauled until 1933  when electric units were introduced. With the arrival of the mid-day Victoria to Brighton service at Brighton Station on 29 June 1934  the Mayor of Brighton  Miss M. Hardy  renamed the train the Brighton Belle  and it retained this title until withdrawal.The stunningly elegant Hornby model initially produced in two distinctive livery periods captures perfectly the opulence and style of the Brighton Belle Pullman. Each Car is lit and complete with detailed interior.This DCC Ready car pack is compatible with analogue train layouts  but can easily be converted for use on a DCC (digital) layout. This loco is  DCC Ready   meaning they feature a special socket ready to receive a DCC Decoder. To convert this locomotive for use on a DCC layout one of the following digital decoder chips are required; R8245 Sapphire Decoder or R8249 V1 3 NMRA Loco Decoder.

It s detail correct up until about 1952 when new bogies were used to help improve the ride and the second(third) class Pullmans changed their logo to simply Car No.88 etc.I have bought the full 5 car set using matching coaches also made by Hornby. The Hornby list price is right for what you get but my budget doesn t go that far so I ve shopped around and found absolute bargains both on amazon and ebay sites as sellers discount their stock to get a quick sale.The train itself runs very well and although there is only one power bogie it is more than adequate to pull the whole 5 car train up the 1 in 30 inclines on my layout.The chassis is made of metal which gives extra adhesion but the real key to this is how Hornby have arranged the power collection for the lighting to run from the power car itself through the couplings to all the cars rather than collect it from each of the carriages  bogies. This way there is no additional friction at all from pick-ups which might reduce power.It runs perfectly well in either direction even though the power bogie is in one of the end driving cars.Well done Hornby and well done amazon for providing the market place where sellers can provide the discount I need.,{seller=>{Seller_name_1=>Howleys Toy Shop  Seller_price_1=>£166.04}}

He absolutly loves the day of the diesels film  so I got him this train  along with Den  Dart and Bell. Its still great fun like all previous trackmaster trains  and is fantastic for any child who loves playing with trains. I think its great for developing imaginative play too  as he now makes the diesels and steamies role play and talk  and we ve painted an old box to make a diesel works. He absolutly loves diesel 10 and takes him everywhere. The only criticism I would have is that he requires a C cell battery  which I have to replace every 2-3 days  but this is probably because my son literally plays with him from the moment he gets up to the time he goes to bed! | Not fit for purpose! // 1.0 // 29 Dec. 2012 // By  Diton     on 29 Dec. 2012 // TrackMaster should redesign this toy.  I gave it to my grandson on Christmas Day.  He had been asking to have a Diesel 10 for months and was so pleased when he opened it.  The battery does not stay in place.  Any jolt or movement dislodges the battery which has only the metal connections to each end holding it in a large space.  We tried packing it with card but in the end playdough all round the battery filling the cavity held it in place so he could play with it.It is so disappointing for children when new toys don t work.  This is not the only Thomas engine that needs better design. | Another happy Thomas purchase! // 5.0 // 9 Feb. 2012 // By  Mrs. Patricia A. Brambley     on 9 Feb. 2012 // I knew what to expect and was not disappointed. Another Thomas the Tank Engine train to add to my grandson s collection.  He was very happy with it. | Good but expensive // 4.0 // 10 Jan. 2014 // By  Miker     on 10 Jan. 2014 // Ok...the engine itself is well made and should last. But  it s damned expensive for what it is.I would also note that the grabber is fixed with only the jaws opening. True  a fully mobile grabber would last around 2 hours with the average small boy but I would just take note in case it s expected.The lad loves it though so minor quibbles only... | Not really a  play set  // 5.0 // 14 Jun. 2012 // By  Adam ADG     on 14 Jun. 2012 // Our son loves the Thomas Trackmaster trains and track. Luckily he already has a couple of sets as this  playset  is just a train.It does say what is included in the details to be fair  but I still think the product name is misleading.I can t fault the train though  other than the claw arm being fixed in place. Its the first thing our lad tried to move! | Great toy for Thomas fans // 5.0 // 20 May 2013 // By  Claire     on 20 May 2013 // My three year old watched day of the diesels recently and all he wanted was a diesel 10 toy. Thank goodness for Amazon as I couldn t find this toy in any toyshop. He is now planning which engine is next on his list.......whichever one he picks  I will be back to Amazon to buy it! | Diesel 10 rides again // 4.0 // 18 Feb. 2012 // By  C. JACKSON     on 18 Feb. 2012 // My 3 year old got this for Christmas  he loves it although his only negative comment was about the grabbing arm on top. It is fixed in place and doesn t move. However  Diesel 10 loves racing around the track up to no good. | One very happy little boy // 5.0 // 4 Jan. 2013 // By  Ms. P. Wilkinson     on 4 Jan. 2013 // Bought this as a Christmas present for a little boy who loved it he is mad about the character. It works well on the track and face is much more realistic than the smaller diecast model.,

This is a very modern style of side-corridor coach  with end-vestibule entrances and â€˜concertinaâ€™ connections for accessing other carriages. Some internal detail can be seen through the windows  such as the partitions and seating (which differs slightly from the 1st and 2nd class coaches)  and there are opaque-window lavatory compartments. The running number is CCu 13017  and the destination board is for a Munich to Berlin service.This model is fitted with the standard â€˜loopâ€™ style of coupling. It is packaged in the current standard Trix card box with a transparent window with a transparent plasticky internal tray with side cover.This is a nicely detailed model of a high standard of manufacture. Note that there are other models available to form a rake of the Munch to Berlin coaches  along with a baggage car.,{seller=>{Seller_name_1=>bw bahn  Seller_price_1=>£41.87}}

I live in London  but find it worth travelling as far as Faversham in Kent to the Hobby Shop there for my models.,{seller=>[{Seller_name_1=>Au Pullman  Seller_price_1=>£20.21}  {Seller_name_2=>tablet_books  Seller_price_2=>£40.99}  {Seller_name_3=>francejouet  Seller_price_3=>£53.15}  {Seller_name_4=>Sam Store US  Seller_price_4=>£90.35}]}

The Southern Railway (SR) was established in 1923  linking London with the Channel ports  South West England  South coast resorts in Kent. It was the smallest of the  Big Four  railway regions with most of it s revenue coming from passenger traffic rather than freight in the more densely populated region of southern England. A number of famous  named  trains were operated by SR including the Brighton Belle  Bournemouth Belle  Golden Arrow  the Night Ferry (London - Paris and Brussels)  Atlantic Coast Express and the Devon Belle. Both Richard Maunsell and Oliver Bulleid served as Chief Mechanical Engineers to the SR between 1923 and 1948 and both designed new locomotives and rolling stock to replace those inherited in 1923. The electrification of the region began in 1929 under the management of Sir Herbert Walker. On completion it was the world s largest electrified railway system. The steel panelled wooden framed bodied were built at SR Eastleigh Works and the steel underframes at SR Lancing Works. Each 2 car unit measured 129ft 6in long and 9ft 2in  wide and were powered by two English Electric traction motors of 275hp (205kW) with a maximum speed of 60mph. The units were fitted with automatic air-brakes The 2-BILs weighed 74tons 15cwt and had a passenger capacity of 24 in the First Class and 84 or 88 Third Class area. The remaining units stayed in service and passed to the newly formed British Railways in 1948 where they were re-classified as Class 401 and continued in service on BR Southern Region but by 1971 all the units have been withdrawn. The 2-BIL unit represented in this pack is the only 2-BIL unit to survive and is numbered 2090 Safety notice: Detailed Scale - model. Not suitable for children under the age of 14.

Originally numbered 4498  Sir Nigel Gresley was due to receive the name Bittern  before the realisation of its commemorative status. As with the earlier LNER A4 Pacifics  it was built with a single chimney and side valances covering the wheels which were later removed to improve maintenance access. Sir Nigel Gresley carries a commemorative plaque as the holder of the post-war steam speed record reaching 112mph in May 1959. As with the Mallardâ€™s record this was achieved descending southward from Stoke Summit  but unlike the Mallardâ€™s special attempt this was with a full train of passengers returning from an excursion. As with other A4s  Sir Nigel Gresley has worn many liveries throughout its career. When released to traffic in October 1937 it carried the standard LNER garter blue of the A4 Pacifics and has since carried various liveries. Sir Nigel Gresley  now bearing the British Railways number 60007 with a British Railways blue livery  was saved from scrapping in 1966 by a small group of men who set up the â€˜A4 Preservation Societyâ€™  later known as â€˜The A4 Locomotive Society Ltdâ€™ and now â€˜The Sir Nigel Gresley Locomotive Preservation Trust Ltdâ€™. â€˜The A4 Locomotive Societyâ€™ has since become the subsidiary company that operates the locomotive for the Trust. The Trust is committed to keeping the locomotive operating and running special excursions on both the main line and heritage railways such as the North Yorkshire Moors Railway where it is based.This is an accurate  detailed scale model in die cast presented in a perspex display case mounted on a plinth.

I think the finish is very good although it is a static model eg. the wheels etc. do not rotate and it is fixed to its stand which is effectively a short length of track. The real locomotive is preserved by the North Yorks Moors Railway and this replica certainly does justice to it.The model is supplied in an outer sleeve which protects a clear plastic case  in the case of my model it also has a removable thin plastic film over part of it as an additional protection. At the price you couldn t really ask for more  and  if like me  you are short of space  the 1:120 scale is ideal.

Mel @mel22@fsmail.net if interested. | Is this set from the Railroad range? // Sorry I don t know  it was bought for my grandson. The only thing I can tell you is that it is compatible with 00 guage. | How much track comes in the box?  Is there enough for a continual loop/oval?  My 4 YO  grandson is train crazy and was thinking of getting it for him // Hi. Yes there is enough for a continual loop. You can also buy extra track should you want to make the loop bigger. | Is it three rail // No  it is oo two rail non digital. | Is this set DCC ready? // Hi yes it is  printed as such on the side of the box | is this a nickel silver track? // Yes,Great train set good value for money // 4.0 // 24 Nov. 2013 // By  Mr Peter J Warren     on 24 Nov. 2013 // Although the review title is positive I do have to start off with a small compliant. Although the package arrived and appeared to be well protected for some reason the front 4 wheels/bogey area was not connected up to the rest of the train and it took a while to figure out how to fix it on properly!That said  I think this is most likely an unlucky one off. The train set is good value for money (especially when compared to the crazy prices for the DCC already installed trains!)  the locomotive and carriages appear to be of a very good standard and it runs excellently so far. No regrets in buying this at all!EDIT - I now have to add another negative point... though it has a happy ending. After a day or so the locomotive stuttered and stopped. It had occurred to me while it was running that it sounded a little rough compared to what it should sound like but the stoppage was quite sudden... though it did get going again it was stuttering still. If you come across this apply some small amounts of machine oil to the areas mentioned in the maintenance guide that comes with this train set and then try and running it for a few minutes and it should return to normal! | LNER S Flying Scotsman. // 4.0 // 3 Nov. 2012 // By  Master1     on 3 Nov. 2012 // This is one of the most popular trains in the world and Hornby has produced a very good model which looks like the real machine.Before I purchased this train set  I did some research and found that there are several versions of the Flying Scotsman train set.The versions are:-1) Flying Scotsman train set which includes two coaches  oval and track pack A.2) Flying Scotsman train set which includes three coaches  oval and track pack A.3) Flying Scotsman train set which includes three coaches  oval with track pack A and B.As I already have the Eurostar train set with Track packs A B C and D I decided to buy No.2. I have used most of the track to integrate it with my existing train set  and will extend it later when I buy some more points. That way I don t have any room for Track Packs E and F.The detail to the engine and the tender are very good and when it runs you can see the connecting rods moving. The three coaches are of good detail  you can see into the windows  each coach has 1st and 3rd class compartments (2nd class disappeard sometime ago) and both the corridor and seats are clearly visible.Putting the train on the track took a little time and care is needed when coupling it to the coal tender and the rest of the train.I found that the Flying Scotsman does require a very flat surface to run one  and time needs to be spent getting all the creases out the base mat.As this train set is at a cost  I would not let young children play with it on their own  but under adult supervision they should be able to enjoy this train set.Read more â€º | Mostly a great set; but not a toy; and ruined by one fundamental design flaw // 1.0 // 24 Nov. 2013 // By  Dr Rick     on 24 Nov. 2013 // Especially as discounted by Amazon  this is a good price for what is mostly an attractive and well made train set. I d classify it as a younger-modeller or beginner s set in that the detailing isn t as fine as Hornby s more expensive models  or of some of the others in the market  e.g. Bachmann.The track is pretty good quality  but does need laying carefully on a hard and properly flat surface - I certainly wouldn t use the trackmat on the floor. Train sets like this really need a level of preparation and investment in a solid baseboard  and without one you ll run into problems like some of the other reviewers.The real problem I have is that the coupling on the rear of the tender that connects it to the carriages is ridiculously flimsy; it s held in place by a tiny thread of unsupported soft plastic; after about ten light uses of the set it s already nearly snapped off and can no longer support its own weight.I purchased this as a project to build with my young son and with memories of the Hornby set I had as a boy. It s really disappointing to find that it s many good qualities are ruined by a small but crucial element that renders it quickly useless. | Better than expected // 5.0 // 26 Dec. 2012 // By  David Wurtzler     on 26 Dec. 2012 // Despite some negative reviews regarding the quality of the layout mat  we decided to take a chance and get this as a Christmas present for our 12-year old son. Surprisingly  the mat turned out to be made of vinyl and not paper as described (I guess that Hornby listens to its customers!). This on top of the high quality track  carriages and engine  it made the perfect gift. A little forward planning helped as we had a sheet of thin board ready to ensure a smooth surface for trouble-free track set-up. The bottom line is that our son is thrilled with the set and is currently shopping for track expansion sets to spend his Amazon gift vouchers on! | Boyhood dream fulfilled - after fifty years! For kids of all ages. // 5.0 // 11 Jan. 2015 // By  S2b an OAP    VINE VOICE on 11 Jan. 2015 // I had small clock-work train sets and  eventually progressed to a small electric train-set with a circular track - the train did smoke (when it was in the mood) but mum was wary of letting me play with it alone and  in any case it only went round in circles. I am now the proud owner of the Flying Scotsman from the famous Hornby and this particular (OLD) little boy is like a dog with two tails (at least). What a wonderful set  designed as a complete starter set with mat  track etc etc.This quality product is very possibly going to be the start of something big  very big. It would make a dream gift for any boy OR girl (whatever age) by a maker that you can trust - and you get an iconic engine as well with its wonderful colour and memories of times past.....,{seller=>[{Seller_name_1=>CHELTENHAM  MODEL CENTRE  Seller_price_1=>£108.95}  {Seller_name_2=>Amazon.co.uk  Seller_price_2=>£108.99}  {Seller_name_3=>Toy Arena  Seller_price_3=>£110.00}  {Seller_name_4=>Howleys Toy Shop  Seller_price_4=>£119.99}  {Seller_name_5=>STARLINGS TOYMASTER  Seller_price_5=>£129.99}  {Seller_name_6=>ToyWarehouseUK  Seller_price_6=>£135.00}  {Seller_name_7=>LambsTOYS  Seller_price_7=>£139.95}  {Seller_name_8=>CLIFFORD JAMES  Seller_price_8=>£139.99}  {Seller_name_9=>Haffsjamms  Seller_price_9=>£139.99}  {Seller_name_10=>Frome Models Centre  Seller_price_10=>£149.99}]}

From 1953 to 1962  996 locomotives were produced  making it the most numerous of all British locomotive classes. As the standard general-purpose diesel shunter on BR  almost any duty requiring shunting would involve a Class 08. The class became a familiar sight at many major stations and freight yards. However  since their introduction  the nature of rail traffic in Britain has changed considerably. Freight trains are now mostly fixed rakes of wagons and passenger trains are mostly multiple units  neither requiring the attention of a shunting locomotive. Consequently  a large proportion of the class has been withdrawn from mainline use and stored  scrapped  exported or sold to industrial or heritage railways.As of 2011  around 100 locomotives remain working on industrial sidings and on the main British network. On heritage railways  they have become common  appearing on many of the preserved standard-gauge lines in Britain  with over 60 preserved.Digital control (DCC) has many advantages over the conventional DC control  however arguably the most dramatic bonus of operating DCC must be the advantages of Operating locomotives fitted with sound. How wonderfully alive can a layout become when sound can be heard from the locomotives? The more modern locomotives such as the Class 60  56  31 and even the ubiquitous 08  each of these classes have their own individual sound and are ready to play their part in adding audible realism to any DCC operated layout. All this is possible with Hornby Digital Sound fitted locomotives.

The more modern locomotives such as the Class 60  56  31 and even the ubiquitous 08  each of these classes have their own individual sound and are ready to play their part in adding audible realism to any DCC operated layout. All this is possible with Hornby Digital Sound fitted locomotives. Box Contains 1 x locomotive,,,GREAT // 5.0 // 28 Oct. 2013 // By  TREVOR ROBERTS     on 28 Oct. 2013 // JUST WHAT I NEEDED.

H. Peppercorn took advantage of Thompson s retirement in 1946 to develop the design into the K1 Class. The K1 Class  which was made up of 70 locomotives  were all built in Glasgow at the North British Locomotive Company s Park Works over a 10 month period between May 1949 and March 1950. As was the North British Locomotive Company s all of the Class were sent to Eastfield shed  Glasgow for running in before being sent to England where they were used for both freight and express passenger workings. Thirty of the Class were sent to the Eastern Region while the remaining forty were dispatched to the North Eastern Region. Many of the North Eastern K1s were often seen as far North as Edinburgh and early on in their working life were regularly used on the West Highland line. A significant number of those allocated to the Eastern Region were based at March. All of the Class were fitted with electric lighting and self-cleaning smoke boxes identified with an SC plate situated just beneath the shed plate while some were fitted with AWS (Automatic Warning System). The first 50 K1 locomotives were outshopped in black with British Railways emblazoned on the tender while the remaining twenty were released with the early BR crest. From 1957 all of the Class received the BR emblem. As described the Class were used throughout the former LNER network as they were proven to be an incredible mixed traffic locomotive with each of the Class being paired with a 4200 gallon tender as used with the LNER/BR Class B1 locomotive. By 1958 the K1s were starting to be transferred from the Great Eastern Region with the result that by 1961 only eight remained at March  however by the middle of 1962 these had been moved to Retford and Doncaster. Withdrawal of the K1s began in December 1962 but it was a very slow demise as it took a full five years before the last locomotive  which was 62005 was withdrawn from service on the Eastern Region in 1967. Luckily 62005 survived into preservation and can be seen operating at the time of writing on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. K1 Class locomotive number 62059 was outshopped from the North British on the 13 December 1949. By 1950 the locomotive was on shed at 51G Haverton Hill where it remained until 1957 when 62059 could be seen on shed Ardsley and then later that year  Darlington. By March 1960 the locomotive was transferred to 51J Northallerton but was returned to Darlington in August of that same year. In February 1966  62059 was rostered to 52F  Blyth (North) where it remained until withdrawal in February 1967. Locomotive BR Class K1 62059 was sold for scrap in April 1967 to Hughes Bolckow  Blyth where later that year the locomotive was cut up.

If the model has a chip fitted by the manufacturer  it is described as DCC fitted. | This is a great success at the ready to run stage // 5.0 // 17 Jan. 2016 // By  Chalcides     on 17 Jan. 2016 // Bagnall industrial locomotives are hardly represented in the model market.  This delightful loco is therefore very welcome!  It adds character to a layout and runs very well - with DCS I would expect it to perform superbly.As a model  it is slightly chunky and possibly a bit taller than original - but it is running on 00 track  so the purists have much to do anyway.  It stands detailing and weathering well and can rapidly be made to look the part.  Bagnall products were characterised by endless variety about a basic design  so small departures from scale are not really an issue.The biggest compromise on looks is with the chassis - but Hornby have made the sensible decision to adopt an available  proven option.  Much improvement in looks can be acheived by installing  skirts  to cover the wheels.  It will then much more resemble the prototype  at little cosmetic and no mechanical work.This is a great success at the ready to run stage  and forms a good base for detailing for the more advanced enthusiast.

However when I received the letters they are green  blue  green  blue  red. Not the best mx of colours  I expected to receive one of each colour  but there is no yellow  the red letter on the end looks a bit odd. If I order again I would specify one of each colour. Also the letters on the carriages are not glued on they just come off which I had not expected. Not quite as robust as I had anticipated. | Detachable letter disappointing // 3.0 // 6 April 2013 // By  Rosalind     on 6 April 2013 // My children love these  but it s very annoying that the letter doesn t actually stay attached to the train.

They are fab fun! Drop them  punch them even throw them down the stairs and watch them shake. The noises are gross enough to keep any little boy amused and the  karate  sounds are great.Great product that should bring a smile to anyone s face. | Fun toy with short play interest. // 4.0 // 29 Dec. 2012 // By  Rose Maybud     on 29 Dec. 2012 // My boys were desperate for these toys for Christmas and Santa didn t disappoint. They make really funny Ninja noises when chucked and thrown around and are very robust. However  there isn t very much you can do with them  so the novelty wears off quite quickly and then they are more like cuddly toys that end up in bed with the kids!Not sure I would recommend buying these toys. It was only a result of excellent advertising in early Autumn which led to my kids adding them to their list for Santa. Also  these toys need AAA batteries  which you need to buy  which is a pain. | For autistic friend // 5.0 // 14 Dec. 2012 // By  C. M.
